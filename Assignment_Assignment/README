	since I took only two classes of C++ course and I still have only basic skill and comprehension of programming, I didn't know what I could do with C++ language or python. through this semester, one thing I was interested was interaction between command line and c++ or python functions. for example, I could open and display a manual of command 'man', even using some other commands I could find specific word in the manual. I think it was not an interesting technic for other people, but for me, it was pretty interesting and made me think about how c language could be more useful. Therefntaore, I want to suggest an assignment about desigining program which is to search and sort manual or any input documents. the programm has to have functions like reading file/manual, dispaly, search specific word and sentences including the specific words and store to the file.

	if total score is assummed 30 points, 'functionality' would be the part that highest percentage points. so for example, I want to assign points like following..
Syntax = 5 points
contents = 5 points
Style = 10 points
functionality = 10 points

	programm should be compiled correctly. students' programms have at least three of those functions. if there is an error while compiling, student will get up to 50% of total score depending on their syntax and contents.
